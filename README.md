# RestaurantPicker

This project was inspired by me and my family never knowing where we want to eat, even though we've been to a variety of great places.
Here I wanted to practice my general Object-Oriented programming, Python, and SQL database querying skills.

# DONE
- Creating Restaurant and Address classes, for easy creation, validation, and implementation in the SQLite database
- Functions to create the restaurant and address table in the database
- Functions to add restaurants and addresses to their respective tables

# IN PROGRESS
- CSV files of restaurants and addresses for batch uploading to database
- Function to ingest these CSV files, create the proper objects with error-handling, and push into the database

# TODO
- Using latitude and longitude data in the restaurant table, create a local map of where these restaurants are
- Command-line interface that allows the user to browse eating options and filter on a few key attributes
